## Data Loading and Initial Exploration:
1. Pandas was used to load the dataset into a DataFrame using the read_csv function, which allowed for easy manipulation and exploration of the data.
2. The first few rows of the dataset were displayed using the head() function to get an initial sense of the data structure, including the columns and their respective data types.
3. Performed a summary of the dataset using info() to check for missing values, data types, and overall dataset structure. This step helped us confirm that the data types were appropriate for the subsequent analysis.
